#About

This project is a solution for the challenge [outlined here](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/Make-School-iOS-Development-Course/blob/master/P1-Assigned-Project/content.md).

The solution focuses on primarily on code design - the UI is kept very simple. It should be good starting point for understanding how apps that use networking and Core Data can be structured and tested.

#Running this Project

1. Checkout this repository using `git`
2. Run `carthage update` to install dependencies - if you don't have carthage you can [read how to install it here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md)
3. Checkout and run the backend server for this app. You can find it in [this repository](https://github.com/MakeSchool/TripPlannerBackend)

#TODO

The solution still contains a few TODOs throughout the source code. These mark portions of the code that could be improved in future.
